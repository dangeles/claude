# Boundary Spanning Research Summary

Research foundations for cross-domain analogical reasoning and knowledge transfer.

## Structure-Mapping Theory (Gentner, 1983)

### Core Principle

Analogies map **relations** between objects, not object attributes. The quality of an analogy depends on systematic structural correspondences.

### Three-Stage Process

1. **Retrieval**: Finding analogous problems (hardest part, influenced by surface similarity)
2. **Mapping**: Building structural correspondences between source and target
3. **Inference**: Generating candidate solutions from the mapping

### Systematicity Principle

Prefer mappings that:
- Preserve higher-order relations (relations between relations)
- Have deep structural similarity
- Generate non-obvious inferences

Example:
- **Good**: "Solar system : atom :: sun : nucleus" (preserves gravitational/electromagnetic attraction relations)
- **Poor**: "Cloud : cotton ball" (surface similarity only, no relational structure)

## Near vs Far Transfer

### Definitions

| Type | Definition | Example | Success Rate |
|------|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Near Transfer** | Same domain, adjacent context | Software bug fixing → security vulnerability patching | High (70-90%) |
| **Mid Transfer** | Related domains, similar constraints | Aviation safety → Healthcare safety | Medium (30-60%) |
| **Far Transfer** | Distant domains, deep abstraction | Biology → Computer Science | Low (5-20%) |

### The Inverted-U Relationship (Keijl et al., 2016)

Innovation potential follows an inverted-U curve with domain distance:
- **Local**: Incremental innovation, low risk, predictable
- **Adjacent**: Optimal balance of novelty and feasibility
- **Distant**: Highest novelty potential but hardest to integrate

## Absorptive Capacity Framework (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990)

### Three Components

1. **Recognize** the value of new external information
2. **Assimilate** it into existing knowledge structures
3. **Apply** it for useful purposes

### Transfer Prerequisites

For successful knowledge transfer:
- **Prior related knowledge**: Target domain must have foundation to understand source
- **Communication channels**: Mechanisms for knowledge exchange
- **Boundary spanners**: Individuals who understand both domains

## Transfer Evaluation Criteria

### Relational Correspondence

Do the causal relationships map correctly?
- **High**: One-to-one mapping of causal chains
- **Medium**: Some relations map, others require adaptation
- **Low**: Surface similarity only

### Systematicity

Are higher-order relations preserved?
- **High**: Deep structural analogy (goal structures, feedback loops)
- **Medium**: Mid-level relations preserved
- **Low**: Only attribute matching

### One-to-One Mapping

Do elements correspond consistently?
- **Good**: Each source element maps to exactly one target element
- **Fair**: Most elements map, some ambiguity
- **Poor**: Many-to-many or unclear mappings

### Functional Equivalence

Do structures serve the same purpose despite different implementations?
- **Strong**: Same goals, same constraints, different mechanisms
- **Moderate**: Similar goals, different constraints
- **Weak**: Different goals, surface resemblance only

## Boundary Objects (Star & Griesemer, 1989)

### Definition

Artifacts that inhabit multiple communities and facilitate collaboration across boundaries:
- Flexible enough to adapt to local needs
- Robust enough to maintain identity across contexts

### Examples in POV-Expansion

- **Rasmussen's Abstraction Hierarchy**: Allows translation between domains
- **Structural analogy diagrams**: Visual representation of mappings
- **Convergence themes**: Shared concepts across perspectives

## Boundary Spanners

### Role

Individuals who:
- Understand multiple domains deeply
- Translate concepts between domains
- Identify structural correspondences

### Characteristics

- High cognitive flexibility
- Tolerance for ambiguity
- Pattern recognition ability
- Communication skills

## Far Transfer Challenges

### Why Far Transfer Is Rare

1. **Surface dissimilarity hinders retrieval**: People don't recognize analogies across distant domains
2. **Adaptation costs are high**: Solutions require significant reconceptualization
3. **Validation is difficult**: No precedent to reference
4. **Context matters**: What works in one domain may fail due to different constraints

### Mitigations

- **Explicit structural mapping**: Document preserved relations
- **Pilot testing**: Small-scale validation before commitment
- **Expert consultation**: Verify mapping with domain experts
- **Iterative refinement**: Expect adaptation, not direct transfer

## Abstraction Hierarchy (Rasmussen, 1985)

### Five Levels

| Level | Description | Question | Transfer Utility |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| 1. Functional Purpose | Why system exists | What goal? | Highest abstraction |
| 2. Abstract Function | Flows and constraints | What transforms? | Good for finding analogies |
| 3. Generalized Function | Process category | What type? | Moderate abstraction |
| 4. Physical Function | Specific mechanism | How works? | Domain-specific |
| 5. Physical Form | Concrete implementation | What looks like? | Lowest abstraction |

### Using for Analogies

- **Ascend** to find commonality (Purpose, Abstract Function)
- **Descend** to apply solutions (Physical Function, Form)

Distance between domains = abstraction level needed to connect them.

## Convergence as Validation

### Why Convergence Matters

When multiple independent domains suggest the same solution:
- **Reduces false positive risk**: Not just one superficial analogy
- **Indicates robust pattern**: Works across contexts
- **Increases confidence**: Triangulated from multiple perspectives

### Convergence Types

1. **Theme convergence**: Same concept appears in 2+ domains
2. **Strategy convergence**: Similar approaches independently arrived at
3. **Structural convergence**: Same relational patterns across domains

## Transfer Barriers

### Common Barriers

| Barrier | Description | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Context dependency** | Solution requires specific context | Identify prerequisites |
| **Terminology mismatch** | Same concept, different names | Create translation glossary |
| **Constraint mismatch** | Different feasibility boundaries | Assess constraint compatibility |
| **Cultural resistance** | "Not invented here" syndrome | Emphasize structural similarity |
| **Expertise gap** | Lack of absorptive capacity | Bring in domain experts |

## Terminology Reference

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Base Domain** | Source of the analogy |
| **Target Domain** | Recipient of knowledge transfer |
| **Surface Similarity** | Shared observable features |
| **Structural Similarity** | Shared relational patterns |
| **Boundary Object** | Shared representation enabling collaboration |
| **Near Field** | Adjacent domains with high overlap |
| **Far Field** | Distant domains requiring abstraction |
| **Systematicity** | Preservation of higher-order relations |
| **Relational Structure** | Network of cause-effect relationships |
| **Absorptive Capacity** | Ability to recognize, assimilate, apply external knowledge |
