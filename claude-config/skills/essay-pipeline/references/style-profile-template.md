# Writing Style Profile Template

**Length guidance**: Keep this under 500 words for optimal context window usage. Be specific and concrete rather than general.

## How to Use This Template

Copy this template to your configured style profile path (default: `essays/style-profile.md`). Fill in each section with honest descriptions of how you actually write, not how you aspire to write. The more specific and concrete your entries, the better the voice matching will be.

If you are unsure about a dimension, leave it blank. The voice-matcher will consult your raw essay samples to fill gaps.

## Voice and Tone
- **Register**: [e.g., "Conversational but precise. I write like I'm explaining something fascinating to a smart friend over coffee."]
- **Formality**: [e.g., "Informal but not sloppy. Contractions yes, slang rarely, profanity never."]
- **Personality**: [e.g., "Curious, slightly irreverent, genuinely excited about the science."]

## Sentence Patterns
- **Average length**: [e.g., "Medium. Mix of 8-word punchy sentences and 25-word explanatory ones."]
- **Rhythm**: [e.g., "I tend to follow a long explanatory sentence with a short punchy one."]
- **Opening patterns**: [e.g., "I almost never start with 'I'. I like opening with a concrete image or a surprising fact."]

## Vocabulary
- **Technical terms**: [e.g., "I use precise scientific terms but always define them in context, never in parenthetical asides."]
- **Hedging**: [e.g., "I hedge with 'tends to', 'in many cases', 'the evidence suggests'. I avoid 'clearly' and 'obviously'."]
- **Words I overuse**: [e.g., "'actually', 'turns out', 'the thing is'"]
- **Words I never use**: [e.g., "'utilize', 'leverage', 'paradigm', 'unlock', 'groundbreaking'"]

## Rhetorical Patterns
- **Analogies**: [e.g., "I use one analogy per complex concept, drawn from everyday life. I avoid sports metaphors."]
- **Evidence presentation**: [e.g., "I lead with the finding, then cite the source, then explain why it matters."]
- **Handling uncertainty**: [e.g., "I'm explicit about what we don't know. I prefer 'we don't know yet' over pretending certainty."]
- **Conclusions**: [e.g., "I end with a forward-looking question, not a definitive statement."]

## Structural Habits
- **Paragraph length**: [e.g., "3-5 sentences. Never more than 6."]
- **Section transitions**: [e.g., "I use the last sentence of each section to set up the next one, not standalone transition paragraphs."]
- **Opening strategy**: [e.g., "I open with a specific, concrete anecdote or data point, never a broad generalization."]
- **Closing strategy**: [e.g., "I close with a question or an implication, never a summary of what I said."]

## Things I Avoid
- [e.g., "Clickbait framing"]
- [e.g., "Listicle format"]
- [e.g., "Excessive qualification ('to be sure', 'of course')"]
- [e.g., "AI-sounding phrases ('delve into', 'it's important to note', 'in conclusion')"]

## Sample Passages That Represent My Voice
[Paste 2-3 short passages (~100-200 words each) that exemplify your writing at its best]

## Express Profile Questions

If you do not have time to fill out the full template, the essay pipeline can create a quick profile by asking these 5 questions:

1. **How would you describe your writing voice in one sentence?** (e.g., "Smart friend explaining cool science over coffee")
2. **What words or phrases do you NEVER want in your writing?** (e.g., "utilize, leverage, it's important to note, delve")
3. **How long are your typical paragraphs?** (e.g., "3-5 sentences, with occasional 1-sentence punchy paragraphs")
4. **How do you handle technical terms?** (e.g., "Use the real term but define it immediately in plain language")
5. **How do you typically end an essay?** (e.g., "With a question, never a summary")

The pipeline will synthesize these answers into a minimal style profile. You can refine it later.
