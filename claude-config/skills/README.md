## Migration from v1.x

**No breaking changes** - all enhancements are additions. Existing workflows continue to work.

**Recommended adoptions**:
1. Use **completion-verifier** before marking tasks done
2. Use **parallel-coordinator** for independent multi-task requests
3. Follow new **reproducibility standards** for Jupyter notebooks (environment docs, random seeds, session info)
4. Check **success_criteria** in YAML to understand completion benchmarks

## Contributing

Skills are designed to be extended and refined based on usage. When adding new skills or enhancing existing ones:

1. Follow contract-style structure (role, goal, constraints, workflow, outputs)
2. Include `success_criteria` in YAML frontmatter
3. Target 1,500-3,500 words for clarity
4. Avoid aggressive language ("ALWAYS", "NEVER", "MUST")
5. Add supporting files to subdirectories (examples/, references/, assets/)
6. Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
