3. **Cross-domain patterns** provide alternative implementation approaches
4. **Completeness metrics** can inform quality gate criteria

**Potential Conflicts**:
- [Areas where structural completeness might conflict with simplicity - note trade-offs]
- [Areas where domain standards might conflict with Anthropic guidelines - Anthropic wins]
- [Areas where thoroughness might conflict with pragmatism - note balance]

- **Structure vs. Simplicity**: Start with essential structural elements, make detailed elements optional
- **Domain Standards vs. Anthropic Guidelines**: Anthropic guidelines win for prompt design, domain standards win for workflow structure
- **Required Fields vs. YAGNI**: Mark as Critical if needed now, document others as future enhancements
