**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Machine**: mac
**Status**: In Progress

## Objective

Add formal workflow instructions for Claude Code Agent when modifying global configuration (skills, settings, plugins) in this repository. This provides Claude with a structured 7-step process to follow, ensuring configuration changes are version-controlled, analyzed, tested, and documented before deployment.

## Changes Planned

- [x] Follow CONFIG_MANAGEMENT.md workflow
- [x] Create CONFIG_MANAGEMENT.md with complete workflow instructions (~600 lines)
- [x] Update README.md with "For Claude Code Agent" section linking to workflow
- [x] Update planning/.template.md with workflow checkbox
- [ ] Create this planning journal entry
- [ ] Commit and push all changes

## Expected Outcome

Claude will have clear, actionable workflow instructions to follow when modifying configuration, ensuring:
1. Changes are version-controlled before affecting live system
2. Quality analysis catches errors before sync
3. Planning journal documents all changes
4. Rollback procedure is clear if issues arise
5. Multi-machine workflow is well-defined
